#+STARTUP: showall

* This is a testing repository for presentation-oriented features in Xournal

Forked from Daniel German's repo to add patches to aid using Xournal for presentations.

The official repository of Xournal is hosted at: http://xournal.sourceforge.net

This fork contains the following feature additions:

- A number of keyboard shortcuts for changing colors and other presentation-oriented features.
- Change of the dated-looking pen cursor into a normal pointer arrow.
